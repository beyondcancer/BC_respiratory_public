**Abstract:**

**Background:** Cancer and its treatment can adversely affect lung health, but long-term respiratory risks in adult cancer survivors remain unclear. We investigated risks of developing new chronic respiratory conditions, or exacerbating existing ones, in survivors of 20 common cancers, compared with individuals with no cancer history.

**Methods:** We used English electronic primary care records, linked to cancer registry, hospital admissions, and death records data. Adults with incident cancer were matched 1:10 to cancer-free individuals on age, sex and general practice. Relative risks were estimated using Cox models, adjusted for confounders. Absolute risks were estimated using adjusted incident rate differences and standardised cumulative incidence curves for new-onset disease, and mean cumulative count for exacerbations. We investigated variation by patient-level factors using interaction terms. 

**Results:** 789,254 adults with incident cancer were included. Compared with cancer-free individuals, elevated risks of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were observed in 11 cancers (Hazard ratio [HR] 5.19 increased risk for lung cancer; other HRs ranging from 1.06-1.72); for 8 of these cancers, raised risks persisted beyond 5 years from diagnosis. Interstitial lung disease risk was raised in 18 cancers  (HRs>5 in CNS, oesophageal and lung cancers, and HR>2 in 7 further cancers); raised risks persisted beyond 5 years after diagnosis in 11 cancers. New-onset bronchiectasis risk was increased in oesophageal, lung and haematological cancers while new-onset asthma risk was raised in non-Hodgkin lymphoma only. Rates of exacerbations of pre-existing respiratory diseases were raised in survivors of oesophageal, liver, lung, pancreatic, central nervous system, and haematological cancers, compared with cancer-free individuals. 

**Conclusion:** Survivors of most types of cancer had substantial and sometimes prolonged raised risk of a range of respiratory conditions, highlighting the need for respiratory health awareness in survivorship care. Targeted management, smoking cessation, and vaccination may be warranted for those at highest risk.
